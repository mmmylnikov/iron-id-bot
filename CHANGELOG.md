# Version history

We follow [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) since the `0.1.0` release.

Semantic versioning in our case means:
- Bugfixes do not bring new features, code that passes on `x.y.0`
  should pass on `x.y.1`.
- Minor releases do bring new features and configuration options.
  Code that passes on `x.0.y` might not pass on `x.1.y` release.
- Major releases indicate significant milestones or serious breaking changes.
